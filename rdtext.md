# radiant drift text draft

- **aries**

  we went out for a special dinner on my 32nd birthday  
  I couldn’t eat a bite  
  waves of sickness rising  
  tidings of the condition of my body  
  I was 6 weeks pregnant  

  I never met my spouse’s mother  
  Gale  
  she was a scientist  
  she took detailed notes about her life, herself, the world around her  
  my spouse is a scientist too  
  he studies the light of celestial bodies  
  as they move in relation to each other  

  eating rocky road ice cream in the public garden  
  I first felt the fetus flutter  
  like a moth at a lamppost  

  at our 18 week appointment, the dr asked us if we could be related to each other  
  a boilerplate question for screening genetic anomalies  
  the commonwealth would allow us to terminate the pregnancy for 6 more weeks  
  no, we said, have no such unknowns in our family histories  
  we don't need any tests  
  we’re prepared to proceed

  I find the notes Gale took on my spouse’s birth  
  and his first year  
  they anchor me  

  I ask him what he imagines Gale thinking of me    
  he says she would call me radiant

  the placenta takes up a metaposition
  between us    
  my new 'us' - me and the baby  
  and gives me great relief  

  the baby hears Gale’s spouse's voice    
  low and loud    
  and they kick like an 808    

  on christmas, the baby becomes viable   
  they will not be born to die    

  new year's eve    
  I eat four kinds of cake  
  And dance 'til 4am  

  I can’t sleep  
  I make myself drones

  my time is still my own  

  the week before the birth    
  I speak in meeting for the first time  
  I’m afraid of the revelation, I tell the friends  

  I have to go to the hospital every day  
  to monitor the tidal force of my blood  
  I’ve become dangerous to the baby  
  each of our bodies a condition of the other’s

  the dr asks me about my education  
  I tell her about the naked female bodies in my dissertation  
  we do the same thing, she says, we laugh
  she's white too
  she'll believe everything I tell her about my body
  I know  
  and that believing is a vital privilege
  one I am uniquely, unjustly afforded

  she is born in march  
  Gwendolyn  
  her daddy catches her
  him and her are an 'us' now too

she has a different blood type than me, we’re incompatible they say  

everyone calls ‘observant’  
she coos herself to sleep

her favorite game is ‘near far’ run close to mirror giggle at ourself  
run far from a mirror, giggle at your reflection  

DOES she recognize herself in the mirror?  

one day she figures out the difference between horn and synths

she's like a little bull with red  

8months  
my mother says should know her name  

DOES she recognize her name?
