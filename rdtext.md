**radiant drift text**

**aries**
We went out for a special dinner on my 32nd birthday
I couldn’t eat a bite
Waves of sickness rising
Tidings of the condition of my body
I was 6 weeks pregnant

i never met my spouse’s mother
Gale
she was a scientist
she took detailed notes about her life, herself, the world around her

my spouse is a scientist too
he studies the light of celestial bodies
as they move in relation to each other

Eating rocky road ice cream in the public garden
And I first felt the fetus flutter
Like a moth at a lamppost

At our 18 week appointment, the dr asked us if we could be related to each other
A boilerplate question for screening genetic anomalies
The commonwealth would allow us to terminate the pregnancy for 6 more weeks
No, we said, have no such unknowns in our family histories
We’re prepared to proceed with this pregnancy; we want to be parents now

**nosey**
the placenta gives me great relief
It takes up a metaposition between us
To mediate our differing needs

i find the notes gale took on my spouse’s birth
and his first year
i ask him what he imagines gale thinking of me
he says she would call me radiant

I teach a lesson on the physics of acoustics
Sound, I tell my students, travels better in water than it does in air

The baby hears their grandfather’s voice
Gale’s spouse
Low and loud
And kicks like an 808

On christmas, the baby becomes viable
they will not be born to die.

New Year’s Eve
I eat four kinds of cake
And dance until 4am
My time is still my own

I can’t sleep

The week before the birth
I speak in meeting for the first time
I’m afraid of the revelation, I tell the friends

I have to go to the hospital every day
To monitor the tidal force of my blood
I’ve become dangerous to the baby
Each of our bodies a condition of the other’s

**rhubarb**
She is born in March
Gwendolyn

Her daddy catches her

She has a different blood type than me, we’re incompatible they say

**lamprey**

Everyone calls her alert and ‘observant’
She can’t tell my horn from my synths
She coos herself to sleep

Her favorite game is ‘near far’ run close to mirror giggle at ourself
Run far from a mirror, giggle at your reflection

DOES she recognize herself in the mirror?

I ask a friend if it is okay to tickle the baby
She says she’s still a part of you

Breastfeeding
If people don’t like it, they say, I don’t want to give up my body that long
I want my body back

It doesn’t feel like I’m giving up my body, it feels like I’m giving up my time
Feels like a choice I’m making, like it is my body I’m giving her space in.

DOES she recognize her name?

8months
My mother came
Said she should know her name
