# radiant drift text

- **aries**

  we went out for a special dinner on my 32nd birthday  
  I couldn’t eat a bite  
  waves of sickness rising  
  tidings of the condition of my body  
  I was 6 weeks pregnant  

  I never met my spouse’s mother  
  Gale  
  she was a scientist  
  she took detailed notes about her life, herself, the world around her  
  my spouse is a scientist too  
  he studies the light of celestial bodies  
  as they move in relation to each other  

  eating rocky road ice cream in the public garden  
  I first felt the fetus flutter  
  like a moth at a lamppost  

  at our 18 week appointment, the dr asked us if we could be related to each other  
  a boilerplate question for screening genetic anomalies  
  the commonwealth would allow us to terminate the pregnancy for 6 more weeks  
  no, we said, have no such unknowns in our family histories  
  we don't need any more tests  
  we’re prepared to proceed

  I find the notes Gale took on my spouse’s birth  
  and his first year  
  they anchor me  

  I ask him what he imagines Gale thinking of me    
  he says she would call me radiant

  the placenta takes up a metaposition
  between us    
  my new 'us' - me and the baby  
  and gives me great relief  

  the baby hears Gale’s spouse's voice    
  low and loud    
  and they kick like an 808    

  on christmas, the baby becomes viable   
  they will not be born to die    

  new year's eve    
  I eat four kinds of cake  
  And dance 'til 4am  

  I can’t sleep  
  I make myself drones

  my time is still my own  

  the week before the birth    
  I speak in meeting for the first time  
  I’m afraid of the revelation, I tell the friends  

  I have to go to the hospital every day  
  to monitor the tidal force of my blood  
  I’ve become dangerous to the baby  
  each of our bodies a condition of the other’s

  the dr asks me about my education  
  I tell her about the naked female bodies in my dissertation  
  we do the same thing, she says, we laugh  
  she's white too  
  she'll believe everything I tell her about my body  
  I know  
  and that believing is a vital privilege  

  she is born in march  
  Gwendolyn  
  her daddy catches her  
  him and her are an 'us' now too

  she has a different blood type than me   
  everyone calls her ‘observant’  
  she coos herself to sleep

  her daddy plays a game with her in the mirror  
  they huddle close to their reflection in glass and he says 'near'  
  then he steps as far back from the mirror as he can
  as quickly as he can  
  and says 'far'
  he repeats the process over and over again  
  she giggles endlessly   
  
  when she starts to crawl  
  she moves towards anything red like a little bull  
  
  for months when I play my horn for her    
  she looks around the room to find
  the source of the reverberations  
  one day she listens, looks around, smiles at me playing, and reaches for the bell      
  she knows it is me  
  
  first she says 'dada'  
  then she turns towards her name  
  39 weeks after her birth  
  she sees me across the room  
  and calls 'mama'  
  while she moves towards me  
  and into my arms
